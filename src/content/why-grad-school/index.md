## An honest confession

> What's more important in life, a PhD or a happy life with the ones you love?

I don't know why I'm in grad school. I don't think I'll ever know. May be I hate myself. Hate myself to the point that I decided not to appreciate the important things in life and just run after the next thing, because you know, everyone else was doing it too!

I still don't know how to get over this. May be when I'm done with my MS, I will take a breather and decide what's more important in life, a PhD or a happy life with your loved ones?
